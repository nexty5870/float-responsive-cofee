### ðŸ”¥ About this project

As I'm learning the basic and before using framework like tailwind I had to refresh my skills and CSS, the goal of this project #1 was to make a 'responsive' design using Float

While I know Float doesn't make a very responsive website, and I did not use relative font-size, the goal was to play / position and understand Float
